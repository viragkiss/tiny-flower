One of my first thoughts while reading this chapter was: does design ought to have moral limitations? I.e. To what extent are designers
required to conform to social expectations and responsibilities (eg respecting disability, or even political correctness) and how much
they can freely play around with their designs? Design clearly has social implications because the objects and processes we encounter
in their daily lives are capable of changing our thinking about the world. I think this is as true to design as it is to art, if not more.
So clearly, designers must be socially responsible.
I think designers today are responsible for creating objects whose appearance AND functionality are equally important. The secret seems
to be making somehting that doesn't only help people live their lives with less physical constraints, but also make them feel amazing
in the meantime. To make disability feel like a blessing or juts a fact of life instead of a burden, because we can still make daily
choices of how we want to look instead of having limited ability to change our appearance. I also agree with what the author said about
simple and universal design, that reaching out to the larger population could mean focusing outside of the target group with a certain
disability and also making simpler, more accessible products. I think because design today is everywhere, making products according to
how experienced the user is with similar products is also a solution, because it does allow people to be as complicated as they wish to be.
I was very impressed by the intricate and beautiful design of Aimee Mullins's different prostheses because it shows that objects designed 
for people with physical limitations can really reinforce positive thinking and one's and others' acceptance towards that person. I think
the idea of beauty and accessibility for everyone is what disability design should reinforce every time it makes new products for people
to use and think about.
