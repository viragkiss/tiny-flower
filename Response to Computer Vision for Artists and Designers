Response to Computer Vision for Artists and Designers:

It's very important to acknowledge that a computer may be powerful, but it still cannot read, recognise and process the physical world
like humans can. As the article mentions, whatever cannot be captured in code cannot be understood by a computer. So essentially we as
creative programmers need to translate subjective experiences to numerical inputs the computer can respond to. So while we got the advan-
tage of getting something done in a fraction of a second, we also find the main disadvantage of the computer: it doesn't really "think".
We have the challenge that more traditional artists often don't: that we have to manipulate our environment, eg introduce contrastful
lighting, in order to let the computer be able to read and respond to such environment and its parameters. Which is actually a greater and
more interesting challenge because now we have to make sense of the world ourselves in two different ways instead of one. We have to under-
stand the world through sensory experiences as well as logical formulas, probability and statistics. The article mentions methods like
frame differencing and background substraction, which can be really helpful for us to think more like computers in our creative endevours.
And this is hard because there is definitely a point where we need to be asking questions like: is our data still real? have we
not manipulated our canvas so much that it no longer reflects what we want to show? Like in any other art form, the question to what extent
an artwork is reactive vs fictional comes up here as well.
