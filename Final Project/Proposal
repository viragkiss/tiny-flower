Overview:

This project is a simulation of the experience of an artist making sand art. Sand art is present in many cultures around the world -I've
especially been inspired by native Aboriginal Australian ceremonies, where sand art is made simultaneously and in reaction to ceremonial
dance, song and poetry. In this exmaple, it is a means through which a person visually expresses her/his ancestral stories. In this
project, I would like to create an experience through which the user can connect with their own inner self, stories and feelings through
my virtual sand art space.

List of parts and equipment needed:

- laptop
- Arduino
- wires
Not in kit:
- touchpad: 3.5inch RPi Display with XPT2046 Touch Controller
- possibly: large TV screen


Outline of the components and their functions in the program:

The Arduino program reads the data of the touch controller as input and sends the data to Processing in the form of (x, y) coordinates.
The touchpad has to be connected in a way that enables only the touch controller and disables the display, as the latter will be
displayed on the laptop or TV screen.

The Processing program reads the (x, y) coordinates of each line drawn by the user's hand on the touch pad and visualises it in a way 
that mimics the natural flowy and grainy qualities of sand. The sand is a pool of colored points. The line looks drawn as the location
of the sand points along the z-axes inscreases (they get pulled into the screen and appear further away). Unlike the sand with which 
artists traditionally draw, the touchpad doesn't sense pressure. This means that the Processing code needs to take the neighbouring
coordinates as well and adjust their z-axis values, pull them away from the user but less so than the central points - this way the
algorithm draws a little tunnel the width of a generic finger (average sized human finger) where it reads the line has been draw on
the touchpad. This program will require the P3D mode.

Circuit setup:

The touchpad is connected by wires to Arduino and acts as a touch sensor. Arduino reads the input of the touch sensor and as output,
generates an array of corrdinates to be sent to Processing. Processing should read null if there is nothing coming from Arduino -eg.
nothing has been drawn.
Arduino is connected to the laptop through a USB cable. The laptop can be connected to a TV screen, which could potentially increase
the cool effects of the program. Processing displays the output on the laptop screen, which might cast it to a TV screen.

Things to learn I don't yet know:

- how to write a program that simulates natural phenomena
- P3D - I have worked with P3D before but not extensively
- using and reading the touchpad with Arduino
- disabling touchpad display while keeping touch controller enabled

Areas of greatest concern:

- getting the touchpad to work accurately and without interruption
- sending the data to processing in a correct format
- getting the natural quality of sand through code
- harmonising input and output and creating the most pleasurable and uninterrupted user experience (essentially optimising setup
and code)
